    shortOverview: 'The first decentralized cryptocurrency, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. It introduced the concept of the blockchain.',
    deepInsight: 'Bitcoin is optimized for security and censorship resistance above all else. Its scripting language is intentionally limited (non-Turing complete) to reduce attack surface. It uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, which is more like cash (you spend specific coins) than a bank account (balance updates).

The 2021-2023 period saw an explosion of innovation: Lightning Network for payments, Ordinals for NFTs inscribed directly on-chain, BRC-20 for fungible tokens, and Runes for a cleaner fungible token standard.

    deepInsight: 'Lightning creates bidirectional payment channels between peers. Two parties lock Bitcoin into a multi-sig address, then transact off-chain by updating a local ledger. Only opening and closing channels hits the Bitcoin blockchain. Payments route through a network of channels (like internet packets) enabling instant, sub-cent transfers.

    deepInsight: 'Ordinals assigns a serial number to every satoshi (there are 2.1 quadrillion). "Inscriptions" embed data (images, JSON, video) into a satoshi\'s witness data, creating Bitcoin-native NFTs without any sidechain. BRC-20 extended this for fungible tokens.
